MLH: [GHW Cloud Week] Building a Chrome Extension Follow-Along

3/19/2025
Part 1: 
Global Hack Week Cloud Week - Full-Stack Chrome Extension

This project, led by Akash (UT) during Global Hack Week Cloud Week, guides participants in building a full-stack Chrome extension similar to Raindrop.io for link storage. The repository covers both frontend (React) and backend (Express, MongoDB Atlas) development, with best practices for secure coding, version control (Git), API testing, and real-time development using tools like Nodemon and Hopscotch.io.

💡 Key Features:

    🛠 Full-Stack Setup – React frontend, Express backend, MongoDB storage
    🔐 Secure Development – Using .env files to protect sensitive data
    🚀 Real-Time Development – Nodemon for automatic server updates
    📋 Best Practices – Git commits, error handling, and API validation

Part 2:
Global Hackathon - Full-Stack Resource Manager

This repository showcases a Chrome extension and web app built during a Global Hackathon, designed as a developer resource manager for organizing links and code snippets, inspired by Raindrop.io. The project covers full-stack development using Express.js (backend) and React with Vite (frontend) while incorporating state management (Zustand), CRUD operations, and best coding practices.

💡 Key Features:

    🔄 Backend with Express & MongoDB – CRUD operations, link/Q&A schemas, error handling
    🌐 Frontend with React & Vite – Modern UI with Mantine UI, Axios for API requests
    📒 Unique "Done List" Concept – Tracks project progress beyond standard to-do lists
    ✅ Best Practices – ESLint & Prettier for code quality, Git version control
    🔧 State Management with Zustand – Simplifies app data flow

Explore the repository, contribute, and enhance your full-stack development skills! 🚀
